# Native-vs-Non-Native-Classification-With-BERT
This project attempts to tackle the problem of native English vs. non-native English recognition. Using a data-set containing passages written by native and non-native speakers, different classification models were tested to classify them. The BERT model provided the highest performance, and was further optimized.
