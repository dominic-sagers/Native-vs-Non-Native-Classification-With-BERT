3,"

The writter opinens that we have reduce unemployment number on country which more employment which have less cost to company becuase less pay to employ."

First of all, when always you say truth people know your words became invalid it is imposible so people always have a trust on you so your relations become greater."
12, My personal experience is a great example of this.

14,T company as a developer after a while when company needs to choose new team mananger between developers CEO chooses me for this poistion after that I asked Why you choose me for this position from CEO his answer was you had enogh skills and so important I can trust you.
15," For this reason, I say the truth is builder of trust in relations."
16,"

Secondly, at the moment you scarde form somthing or somebody you lies ;However saying truth showes your having self confident and brave."
17," Drawing from my own experience, When was going to schools one day I did not do my homeworks and my teacher was so strice and she punished the students that did not done their howeworks I had two options on this day do not go school and force my mom to call school and say I am sick, secondly go school and take my punishment."
18, that day I choose was second choice.
19, My teacher tells my mothers your kid is brave my mother ask her why you say this opinien about my child her answer was I has no afried of tells truth about his bad action and take the punishments.

28," The speaker similar Polar dinasaurs was endotherms argument, the orator weakens this subject by this activity shows dinasours have high energy and the body sructure show dinasours's heavy weghit that counter the issue."
29,"

Finally, we have the haversian canals on bones, and the lecture informs us that dinasours had changes on their growing speed that was faster on warm weather condition and slower on cold weathers, which we can counter by endotherms growing has unchanged by weather changes."

Both reading and listening debate on the online encyclopedias pons and cons, the online encyclopedias's writers academic credentials, could be hack or edit by none trusted user and only have popular topics in article."

45," I feel this way for two main reasons,more people have modest level of well-bing and the new techlongies helps people which I will explore in the following paragraphs."
46,"

First of all, more people have minimum level of well-bing on last 21 cenetry."
47," they have easier access to clean water, hospital, musiem and school."
48, My grandpa experience is a great example of this.
49, he told us his sister died because his rular river become unfoul and it had a deasies althoght that happend because other vilagers wash a died body on the river at night time.

56,"

In conclusion, our life is much more easy that our old generation."

64, Similar to buzzers lay about the product argument.
65," the orator weakens this subject by people ask many questions such as how long you use the product, and buzzers should answer the questions that counter the issue."
66,"

The essayist suggests buzzing advertisment has negetive effect on social relationships that people cannot trust each others, because they do not know who has motivtion to advertiment or is a real user of the product."

According to the author, edmontosaurus migrate to hospiatable regions in the south on winter."
125," But the specker contradicts this clamis base on the edmontosaurâs diet, many edmontosaur fossils have been found from the same site, and physically capable of a long distances trip."
126,"

The author strongly proposes that edmontosaurâs diet proves the migration porposial because it, only, eats plants."
127, plants can not grow during the Alaska's North Slope.
128," However, the sunshine has changed since edmontosaurâs years and in those years, in summer the Alaska's North Slope had full sunshine during summer, which plants could grow better so edmontosaur could eat dead plants in winter, specker effectively casts doubt on the author's issue argument."
129,"

The writer opinens that many edmontosaur fossiles have been found in the same site so they lived in groups like many modern migratory animals."
130," Similar to edmontosaurâs diet argument, the orator weakens this subject by other modern animals live in other places have the same herds system and they do not migrate that counter te issue."
131,"

The essayist suggests adult edmontosaur's bodies were support of long distance trip that bodeis capable to run with speed of 45 kilometers per hour."
132,"  The specker diverges from this viewpoint by highlighting that adult bodies had this capablity and young edmontosaur had not this power, the essayist's suggestion must be incorrect."
133,"

According to the author, patients' medical records should keep in electronic databases which has many advantages over the paper-based system."
134," At the same time, the speaker denies these benefits based on saving money, less human error, helping medical research."
135,"

The author strongly proposes that this new system cause less money over than the old system because the new system can free up storage rooms which store papers of patients' medical records."
136," Also, it has essaier access to a patient's records and can save the transport cost."
137," However, a doctor should keep the paper records which needs in a legal prosses, the speaker effectively casts doubt on the author's issue argument."
138,"

The writer opines that the electronic system has less error which pervents the unreadable doctor's handwriting."
139," Moreover, it has a standard records system which has more organization than the paper-base system."
140," Similar to the saving money argument, the orator weakens this subject by doctors use the paper-base system for taking notes and the office staff write the doctor handwriting to a computer, that counters the issue."
141,"

The essayist suggests the new system aids medical research which researchers can use from this records on their researchs."

Over the past few years, busy and over working parents have become more than earlier because parents want to make a great life for their children."
144, Many overworking parents today still have mixed views on whether they should do fun and enjoy their time or do schoolworks or check their children workouts in their little free time.
145," In my personal view, I strongly like do have fun time or chill with the kid beside than schoolworks and check the kid's homework."
146, I feel this way for two main reasons which I will explore in the following essay.
147,"

To begin with, children need a strong connection with thier parents, at the same time, busy parents which have a limited time to spend with their children, could not make their relation with their children strong enough."
148," Moreover, after a long time, children will see their parents as a coworker which is a bad view for a child."
149," Playing and have fun with anybody could make a good relation in a short period, so overworking parents can play and have good time with their children to make a strong relationship and fill their empty place."
150,"

On top of that, their parents have less possiblelty to do a craime or a inlegal action."
151,"

To make a long story short, busy parents should focus their children have nice time and enjoy it rather than do their homeworks in their little free time."
152," This is because the children will have a stronger connection to their parents, and the children may do craime less."
153,"

Over the past few years, workers unioun have got more power to defence workers' right which helps workers and their families have a better life."
154, Many workers today still have mixed views on whether they have a better day if they have many not same shapes of jobs to do during a workday or have similar tasks all days.
155," In my personal view, I strongly agree with this statement, when workers have different types of task to do in a day, they are more satisfied and happier."
156," I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay."
157,"

To begin with, different shapes of jobs create a uniqe person during the workday because any workers have a uniqe issue to do in a workday which make all workers different than other workers."
158," Moreover, it is possilbe that a worker did the same task many years ago and a new worker can talk to him or her to gain the worker experiece and make a friendship which is better to workers cominiuty and connection."
159," As a result, workers have better day at the work when they do more different types of tasks during the workday."
160,"

On top of that, workers gian more varied experience when do different types of tasks which help them to have a better carrer path."
161, A person starts working with the dream of become better and after time become a manager of his or her section.
162, To become a manager the person should have many experiece which made by doing different tasks and shapes of tasks.
163," However, doing similar tasks do not give them the option to make vaired knowledge."
164," It is clear to see a reason why, workers are more satisfied when have many different types of jobs than to do the same types of jobs during the workday."
165,"

To make a long story short, workers have better day when they have varied jobs type to do during the workday."
166," This is because different tasks' types make them a uniqe person, and they gain more experience in vaired tasks' types."
167,"

Nowaday, people have more jobs and their jobs become complex and harsh to do."
168, People today still have mixed view on they do not alot things well because they have so many different things.
169," In my personal view, when people have many task to do, they can not do things well."
170," I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay."
171,"

To begin with, when a person has many tasks, his/her foucs decrease."
172, This because of his/her mind can not be complete free and  think about a job.
173," however when a person has a task, his/her mind can only think about the task."
174, he/she can think about all of details and viewpoints of the task.
175," As a result, the person can do a thing very good."
176," For example, a professor has degree about on field of sience."
177, the professor teach only his/her field at university.
178," 

On top of that, when a person has to many things, he/she does has enoegh time."
179," Therefore, a task needs time to pay attation and solve the task, so a person has limited time on day and he/she must do all tasks."
180,However a person with one job has time to think and can foucs on the task.
181," As a result, he/she do the task with out a problem."
182," For instance, a enginer can solve a problem about mathmatic ont 

To sum up, People can not do many tasks well because they have many jobs."
183," This is because they lose their focus on a task, and they do not have enogh time for a task."
184,"

Over the past few years, new systems like cell phone become popular in young children and they should learn how to work with them."
185, Many teachers still have mixed views on whether new techlonogy make their job more harder than past or not.
186," In my personal view, I strongly disagree with this statement, new systems, such as social neworking apps and web sites help students to learn easier than past times and spending time with them helps them to have more inforamtion."
187," I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay."
188,"

To begin with, new techlonogy helps children to learn better an easier because these systems opened new ways to teach kids like videos and learning games, which help students to learn and parctice subjects without any teacher, only a app assists and teaches them."
189," It is clear to see a reason why kids have time with these new tech, learn easier than past children."
190," For example, my young brother learn germany from an app without any class and teacher in the same time he shoud spend in class to learn a new language."
191," 

On top of that, on eailer time was other things that gain kids foucs like palying in street with other friends."
192," At the same time, many men and women learn and study because they controled the play time perido and studied more."
193," It is the same system for today kids, they should manage the play time span and have control on time peride in social networking apps."
194," For instance, my mother always siad she and her firends plaied games on streets in summer however me and my friends playing online games in summer and both have control on playing time duration."
195,"

To make a long story short, today, teaching children is easy task because they have time with new systems."
196," This is because they learn many things form new systems, and in past time, their was other items that children played with them."
197,"

Firstly, children spend a majority of their time at home with their parents."
254, So the influence of parents will be much more on them.

Movies are one of the most important means of entertainment in todayâs world."
269," Many of the people believe that movies could be watched on phone rather than in cinema, while some believe that it more fun watching movies in cinema."
270, This essay will discuss on explore both the view with relevant examples.
271,"

During COVID times, everyone was instructed to stay home by initiating lockdown."
272, During this time most of the people found convenient watching movies on phones and also found it very cost effective option.
273,"Â  For example, Netflix, amazon have started releasing movies even before they got released in theater and you just need to pay subscription fee to watch movies."
274," Due to this people started spending more time with families, enjoying movies at home."
275, On other hand it also had disadvantages as it is making people use mobiles more often and also getting them restricted to their house.

Despite the convenience, experience plays more important role in watching movies."

In this modern world, people are so busy in their own life that they hardly interact with their neighbours."
286, Sometimes they donât even know the name of the people living close to them.
287," There could be many reasons for these, one of them could be their busy life."
288," Notwithstanding, the disclosure delves into these vantage points, and subsequently will explain why I think so."
289,"

Firstly, I think people are socializing less with the families living nearby."
290, The reasons could be their hectic job schedule.
291," Because everyone is so involved in their jobs, that they hardly get to spend the time with their spouse or kids."
292," For instance, I have a friend who works in a particular company, and his work schedule is at least 10 hours per day for 6 days a week."
293," And, thatâs why they try to spend the time with their children, and not with their neighbours."
294," Conversely , in past, people invest their time meeting others because there was no means of distraction such as phones, computers etc."
295,"

In order to solve this, I think families should leave in an environment where there is more interaction with the families living in their proximity."
296," For these ,society apartments could be the best place where the society members can arrange weekly or monthly social gatherings to get to know everyone better."
297,"Â  For example, in the society I live in, the society members send invitations to various events where everyone can come with their families and chill."
298," We get together inÂ  groups and play games , eat together and chill."
299,"

In conclusion, I think people should give some time meetingÂ  new people, and getting to know each other."
300," Also, in the current ,world there are so many gadgets which keep people interacting with other people."
301,"

Having a good friend is an absolute blessing of life, however the quality that defines a good friend have always been questioned."

303," This essay will outline why some people believe that it is necessary to have healthy arguments with friends, but why it is better to have friends who can agree with each other."
304,"

It is feasible to believe that disagreements between friends can play a role in regard to personal growth."
305," To be more specific, while people argue about different opinions, they can learn new perspectives, knowledge and ideas."
306," That is to say, if people have friends that one have a different opinion to another, it will result in having nourishing discussions and benefit each other to grow more."
307, So people have sufficient reasons to insist that having friends with different thoughts is beneficial.
308,"

However, the quality of friends does consist in neither personal improvement nor obtaining more knowledge, it is close to mental support."
309," To explain, people can learn knowledge and acquire different views ofÂ  life or subjects from other options such as a teacher, a colleague, the internet."
310, However they are not able to replace the role of a friend which is being next to each other and support with heart.
311," Therefore, it is of paramount importance for friends to have similar opinions to rely on each other."
312,"

In conclusion, there are definitely some advantages from being friends with someone whose opinion differs from another, as it could light up to new views of any matters and prevent from staying in closed thoughts."
313," Nevertheless, it is essential to remember that friends are there to support each other mentally not educationally."
314," Thus, the quality of good friends is subject to being friendly and supportive rather than being against one another."
315,"

It depends on your dataset and the number of features."
345," But generally, the best way to feature selection is Matrix covariance and histogram and feature methods such as PCA and chi Score and lasso, etc and machine learning model to select the best features, like Random Forest."
346,"

In order to your question, one way isÂ normalizedÂ allÂ Pearson coefficientÂ scores results from 0 to 1 orÂ score sortingÂ ofÂ feature selection methodsÂ (like PCA)."
347, ThenÂ clusterÂ the scores byÂ K-mean or DB-Scan.
348, The class with minimum scores should be reviewed.
349, The minimum scores on the weak class generally should be dropped carefully with trial and error byÂ machine learning method test.
350, If the accuracy goes up(without overfitting) it means you are right.

Secondly, most teenage prefer to spend their time with computer games rather than studying books or some cultural activities 

In conclusion, for keeping the tradition alive, parents and schools need more collaborate to save costume from being lost in addition parents have to allocate more time to their children
